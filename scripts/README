The scripts in this folder were used to generate the results in the manuscript at some point along the process.

The vast majority of analysis was performed with the Hybrid_NMC.Rmd file (check here with questions first).

Additionally, scripts were uploaded to MSI to perform many iterations of various model trainings. The order 
these should be run is as follows:
1. ML_Model_Build_Array.R (Local - builds the array used for training)
2. ML_Model_Run_Array_Loop (MSI - runs for loop used for training models)
    a. The script above automatically submits a job for ML_Model_Run_Array.sh
    b. The script above automatically submits a job for ML_Model_Run_Array.R
3. Model_Performance_Concatenation.sh (MSI - concatenates results from previous step)

We also found that scanning samples across different NIR machines led to small changes in spectral profiles,
so I developed a script to correct the scans based on the scans of 20 samples on both machines in question.
This script is NIR_Scan_Correction.R

For the genomic prediction hapmap dataset, we needed to downsample the number of markers based on LD 
(LD_Downsample.sh - run on MSI) as well as other parameters (Hapmap_Filtering.py).

We also needed to combine spectral and compositional data for the manuscript (combining_spectral_and_comp_data.R)
