# Hybrid Nixtamalization Moisture Content Prediction

## Purpose:
Food-grade corn is an economically important crop in the United States and worldwide. However, 
in the United States, it makes up less than 2% of the corn grown by acre. This has led to reduced 
resources for improving food-grade corn, which affects the manufacturing process and downstream consumer
satisfaction with final products. One trait that impacts many other quality traits is the amount of 
water absorbed during the nixtamalization process. Methods have been proposed for measuring this multi-impact
trait, but either require large amounts of sample or were designed for inbreds. This work has developed a 
low-quantity prediction model specific to hybrids. It uses said model to assess the effects of grain traits 
(composition, yield), and parental combinations on a hybrid's nixtamalization moisture content.
