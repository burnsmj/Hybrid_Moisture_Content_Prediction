## Purpose:
Food-grade corn is an economically important crop in the United States and worldwide. However, 
in the United States, it makes up less than 2% of the corn grown by acre. This has led to reduced 
resources for improving food-grade corn, which affects the manufacturing process and downstream consumer
satisfaction with final products. One trait that impacts many other quality traits is the amount of 
water absorbed during the nixtamalization process. Methods have been proposed for measuring this multi-impact
trait, but either require large amounts of sample or were designed for inbreds. This work has developed a 
low-quantity prediction model specific to hybrids. It uses said model to assess the effects of grain traits 
(composition, yield), and parental combinations on a hybrid's nixtamalization moisture content.

## Pipeline Description:
This project has developed a machine learning model to predict nixtamalization moisture content from NIR
spectra of ground, raw maize kernels. This requires samples to undergo a grinding (destructive) and NIR scanning
process and a benchtop cooking process (destructive) to collect the predictive features (NIR spectra) and predicted 
trait (nixtamalization moisture content). 300 samples were had 50g of sample allocated for grinding and scanning 
(requires at least 30g) and 200g of sample allocated for cook tests (2 reps of 100g). Samples were ground and scanned
first to provide spectra for selecting diverse samples for training.

After samples were selected, initial cook tests were performed to train a preliminary model, which was used to select
more samples to broaden the spectral diversity of the training set. The preliminary model (and subsequent models) 
were trained using supercomputing resources to determine the best combination of data preprocessing, model, hyperparameters,
etc. This process was repeated 100 times to get an estimate for performance variation and allowed us to pick the best model
combination available for the given dataset. After the best model for the final training set was chosen, the model was
used to predict on the larger dataset of samples available. 

Using these samples, we assessed the relationship between hybrids (using the model from this manuscript) and their inbred
parents (using the model from Burns et al. 2021), environmental influences, and the ability to create genomic prediction 
models the can predict hybrid performance based on computational derivation of hybrid genomic markers.
